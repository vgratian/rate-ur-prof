***rate ur professor:***

Here is an application/software that allows students to rate and review their
professors. It is especially designed for American University of Armenia, but
can be used for any other university as well.

I hope that it will help students to choose professors that better meet their
expectations. Constructive feedback will also help professors to improve their
teaching career.
