<s>Expected release date of Alfa version: January 10, 2017.</s>

Alpha version: complete as of 16 Jan 2017!
This is a entirely minimal version with a console based interface,
Allows users to login, register, add review and browse reviews.

Next stage:
A web based interface.
Currently looking for an easy-to-start http-framework. (Maybe a python framework?)
(I know how to run a django/flask webserver, but how do I combine a c++ backend with python web server?)

Expected Beta (with web interface) release date: 6 February, 2017.


***rate ur professor:***

Here is an application/software that allows students to rate and review their
professors. The current version is designed for students of American University of Armenia,
but the software can be used for any other university as well.

I hope that it will help students to choose professors that better meet their
expectations. Constructive feedback will also help professors to improve their
teaching career.
